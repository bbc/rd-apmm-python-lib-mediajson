"""
This module contains methods and classes to extend json encoding and decoding
to cover timestamps, uuids, and fractions. The mutable types are provided by
default and if you require the immutable types then import from immutable instead.

To make use of it either use the dumps, loads, dump, and load functions in
place of the versions from the standard json module, or use the classes
NMOSJSONEncoder and NMOSJSONDecoder as your encoder and decoder classes.
